          My name is Simona Baltog, and I started to study music when I was five years old. My first musical 
          instrument was the piano, after which I studied the flute and, in high school vocal singing. 
          During my university studies, I became a soloist collaborator  at the National Opera House of 
          Cluj-Napoca, a beautiful city situated in Transilvania's heart, in Romania.

          During my collaboration with the National Opera House, I had opera performances for children, such 
          as:” Hansel and Gretel,” “The Sound of Music,” and many other concerts and collaborations. In the 
          same city, I have finished my studies at the Gheorghe Dima National Music Academy with a Master's 
          Degree. I had the opportunity to work with Elena Botez and Niculina Mirea- both opera soloists with 
          a beautiful career. In my learning process next to these two ladies, I've deeply understood music, 
          its true meaning, its purpose, and how to become a true professional singer. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Music and drama will require only one thing from you: patience. But the gifts you will get will be 
          like a treasure, and the glory is in you. As a professional singer, I always wanted to discover more, 
          to understand better. Because it's a continuous process of learning, I participated in many Master 
          Classes conducted by famous opera soloists such as Viorica Cortez, Marina Krilovici, Ludovic Spiess, 
          Eugenia Moldoveanu, Mariana Nicolesco, and Vincent Liotta.

          My story about giving classes started when I was a student helping different colleagues. I always 
          loved sharing, supporting, and pointing out the best things that already were inside them. Because 
          of my true passion for music and human beings, I wanted to bring more, and in 2015 I opened my 
          activities at “Atelierele de Muzica si Teatru ale Traistutei Fermecate” (The Workshops of Music and 
          Theatre of Enchanted Pouch), centered on Music and Drama classes, singing lessons, and piano lessons 
          for children and adults.  What an adventure, what a blessing to give and to get.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, a new adventure has begun with Improvised Echo by Simona Baltog. I invite you to discover the 
          magic that resides in you with music, drama, singing, or piano lessons. I invite you to allow 
          yourself to be better for yourself. I invite you to put your fears away and embrace the unique 
          being that you already are. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Improvised Echo is an artistic place with a story about experimenting, improvising, creating, 
          connecting, and sharing your vibrations with Simona Baltog through music. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Improvised Echo is a story about people with a unique imprint.
