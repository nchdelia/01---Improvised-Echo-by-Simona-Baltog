          My name is <span>Simona Baltog</span>, and I started to study music when I was five years old. My first musical 
          instrument was the piano, after which I studied the flute and, in high school vocal singing. 
          During my university studies, I became a <span>soloist collaborator</span> at the National Opera House of 
          Cluj-Napoca, a beautiful city situated in Transilvania's heart, in Romania.

        <p>
          During my collaboration with the National Opera House, I had opera performances for children, such 
          as:” Hansel and Gretel,” “The Sound of Music,” and many other concerts and collaborations. In the 
          same city, I have finished my studies at the <span>Gheorghe Dima National Music Academy</span> with a Master's 
          Degree. I had the opportunity to work with Elena Botez and Niculina Mirea- both opera soloists with 
          a beautiful career. In my learning process next to these two ladies, I've deeply understood music, 
          its true meaning, its purpose, and how to become a true professional singer.

        Music and drama will require only one thing from you: patience. But the gifts you will get will be 
        like a treasure, and the glory is in you.

           As a professional singer, I always wanted to discover more, 
          to understand better. Because it's a continuous process of learning, I participated in many Master 
          Classes conducted by famous opera soloists such as Viorica Cortez, Marina Krilovici, Ludovic Spiess, 
          Eugenia Moldoveanu, Mariana Nicolesco, and Vincent Liotta. 
        </p>

          My story about giving classes started when I was a student helping different colleagues. I always 
          loved sharing, supporting, and pointing out the best things that already were inside them. Because 
          of my true passion for music and human beings, I wanted to bring more, and in 2015 I opened my 
          activities at “Atelierele de Muzica si Teatru ale Traistutei Fermecate” (<span>The Workshops of Music and 
          Theatre of Enchanted Pouch</span>), centered on Music and Drama classes, singing lessons, and piano lessons 
          for children and adults. What an adventure, what a blessing to give and to get.
