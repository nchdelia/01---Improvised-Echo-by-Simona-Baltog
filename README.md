# Improvised Echo

Improvised Echo is my first real project as a self-taught developer. 
It is a presentation website and it was designed for Simona Baltog, a former opera soloist who offers music and drama classes for children and adults, as well as singing and piano classes. 

It is a static front-end website made from scratch. The site preloader is also my creation, the animation being done only in CSS. 
Overall, I wanted the website to have a playful vibe, in order to represent the personality of its owner and the activities that Simona has.
